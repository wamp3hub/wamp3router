# WAMP3Router

The WAMP3Router is a high-performance router for WAMP3 applications. It provides efficient and robust message routing between different parts of your application.

The router is built with scalability and robustness in mind. It can handle high volumes of messages without compromising on performance, making it suitable for both small and large-scale applications.

WAMP3Router supports various client libraries including
[JavaScript](https://github.com/wamp3hub/wamp3js),
[Python](https://github.com/wamp3hub/wamp3py),
and [GO](https://github.com/wamp3hub/wamp3go),
providing you with the flexibility to choose the technology that best fits your needs.

Whether you're building a real-time application, a multiplayer online game, or an IoT network, WAMP3Router can help you ensure that your messages get to where they need to go.

Router implements the open Web Application Messaging Protocol (WAMP) registered at
[IANA](https://www.iana.org/assignments/websocket/websocket.xml)
that provides
[Routed Remote Procedure Call (RPC)](https://wamp3hub.github.io/documentation/usage/rpc) and [Publish & Subscribe (PubSub)](https://wamp3hub.github.io/documentation/usage/publish-subscribe)
messaging patterns.
